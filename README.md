# Crime Rates in San Francisco

### Tasked with visualizing crime rates in San Francisco, I created a choropleth map.
Given a csv file of police department incidents, I had to transform and restructure the data to better format it for a choropleth map.

After performing some data conversion, grouping, and aggregation, I was able to come up with a dataframe that represented the total number of crimes in each of San Fransisco's ten neighborhoods
